        <h1>Privacy Policy for Emberfox Games</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: August 1, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Emberfox Games ("we," "our," or "us"), a mobile game development company with an address at Gruszkowa 1, 55-300 Środa Śląska, Poland, is committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("user" or "you").</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we, and our third-party partners, collect, use, and share information when you play our mobile games (our "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We and Our Partners Collect</h2>
        <p>While we at Emberfox Games do not directly collect personal data ourselves, our Services integrate third-party services that do. This data is essential for operating our games and providing a free-to-play experience supported by advertising.</p>
        <p>The primary third-party service we use is <strong>Google AdMob</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>Our games use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC. To display ads, AdMob may collect and process data, which can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Your device's advertising ID (Google Advertising ID on Android or ID for Advertisers on iOS).</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> To estimate your general location and serve relevant ads.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> Information about the ads you are shown and how you interact with them (e.g., clicks, views).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is used for purposes such as frequency capping (not showing you the same ad repeatedly), ad personalization (showing ads relevant to your interests), and measuring the effectiveness of ad campaigns.</p>
        <p>You can learn more about how Google collects and uses this data by reviewing <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing Data (for EEA/UK Users)</h2>
        <p>For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the specific context.</p>
        <p>The primary basis is <strong>your consent</strong>. When you first launch our app, you will be presented with a consent dialog asking for your permission to collect data for personalized advertising. You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time through the settings in our app or by resetting your device's advertising identifier.</p>
        <p>If you do not provide consent for personalized ads, you may be shown non-personalized, contextual ads, which still require limited data processing (like using your IP address) based on our legitimate interest to generate revenue to support our Services.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident of the EEA or UK, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You can request copies of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You can object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You can request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@emberfox.online">support@emberfox.online</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children under the age of 16 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We rely on the security measures of our third-party partner, Google, to protect your data. Google uses industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect the information it collects. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within our games or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
